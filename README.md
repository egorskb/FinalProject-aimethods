# Ai advanced methods

## Overview
This project processes image and speed data, prepares datasets, and trains a machine learning model to predict speed from images.

## Steps
1. **Imports and Configuration:** Load necessary libraries and configuration parameters.
2. **Data Loading:** Load speed data and image data from sources.
3. **Utility Functions:** Define functions to match speed data with image timestamps.
4. **Dataset Preparation:** Split data into training, validation, and test sets, and create a custom dataset class.
5. **Model Training:** Train the model using the prepared datasets.
6. **Visualization:** Visualize results with plots.
